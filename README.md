## Work Day Scheduler Assignment
For this assignment, I was tasked with the challenge of creating a dynamic day - planning application that saves to local storage in each of the time slots.

As time progresses, the slots will turn different colors. 

Grey= past
Red = present
Green = future

It should match up with the local time so that it is color coded accordingly.

For example, right now as I am writing this readMe it is 5:14 pm. This is a screenshot of what it looks like so far:

<img width="1154" alt="Screen Shot 2020-11-20 at 5 13 13 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72670039/99854914-bb532380-2b53-11eb-82b2-58f1b5459adf.png">

Everything is greyed out except for the last block, which is red for the present.

If I had done this at 4:14 pm, then the 5 pm block would be colored green.


## Motivation

I found jQuery to be very useful and a lot easier to manage than vanilla javascript. Once I got the application to finally work, I felt great pride and joy in my work.
